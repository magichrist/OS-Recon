# OS-RECON
> A local reconnaissance dashboard for digital footprint analysis. Unlike standard username checkers, OS-Recon combines passive social scanning with active deep-profile extraction - spawning isolated stealth browser instances using `nodriver` to bypass anti-scraping walls and pull raw metadata that static scanners can't reach.

Built around three engines: a fast async social scanner, a stealth browser orchestration layer (`nodriver`), and a GitHub intelligence module that audits repositories, parses commit history, and extracts developer metadata automatically.

Results are split into prioritized risks and general logs - designed with structured data output in mind for downstream analysis.

> !! Early MVP: expect bugs and unfinished modules.

## FEATURES ATM: (readme last updated on June 8, 2026)
- **DeepPry Launchpad UI:** Profile view tracking target accounts with automatic cross-origin media fallback protocols.
- **Stealth Browser Orchestration:** Advanced deep-recon module (`nodriver`) spawning concurrent, isolated headless Chrome instances to bypass anti-scraping walls.
- **Deep Profile Telemetry Extraction:** Captures metadata blocks including bio extracts, cross-referenced outbound links, and dynamic platform-specific variables.
- **FastAPI Backend Server:** Handles asynchronous tasks, fetching via `httpx` & `curl_cffi` to collect target registry metrics concurrently.
- **Dual-Engine Analytics Tab:** Interface sub-tab selector that separates raw telemetry calculations from synthesized intelligence platforms without state loss.
- **Automated AI Threat Cognition Engine:** Prompt-engineered pipeline powered by Groq (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) that filters out scraper boilerplate noise and converts raw telemetry dumps into a structured, defensive terminal risk evaluation report.
- **Automatic GitHub Deep Scan:** Intelligence module utilizing the GitHub API to parse repository risks, extract exposed metadata, and flag hidden email addresses in commit histories.

## TODO:
- Implement custom metadata/data overrides and manual imports to enrich target data before executing cognitive completions.
- Add more deep scraping features (video metadata for social media, etc.)
- Improve on the scanner to yield less false positives.

## FUTURE FEATURES TASKLIST:
- Deep source code scanner looking for secrets inside files.
- Port to electron for easier running.

## How to Run
> **Disclaimer: This tool is developed strictly for educational, security auditing, and authorized open-source intelligence research. The developer assumes no liability for misuse or violations of third-party terms of service.**

Requires Python 3.10+ and Node.js 18+. Chrome must be installed for the stealth browser module.

### AI Analysis Activation (Optional)
> The cognitive threat intelligence tab requires a Groq API token. If you choose not to use the AI analysis engine, the core passive scanners, GitHub parsing, and nodriver stealth orchestration layers will still function completely normally without it.

1. Head to the Groq Console.
2. Generate a new API key under the API Keys management dashboard.
3. Create a .env file in the backend/ directory and append your key:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_high_security_token_here
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn main:app
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`, backend on `http://localhost:8000`.
