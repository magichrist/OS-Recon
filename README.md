# OS-RECON

A local desktop reconnaissance and asset-auditing dashboard. It takes a target handle or link, queries public networks, runs custom evaluation logic on the data, and splits the findings into prioritized risks vs. general logs.

## FEATURES ATM: (readme last updated on May 31 2026)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Tabbed dashboard UI with Overview, Analytics, and Social overview sections.
- FastAPI server backend running asynchronous, fetching with httpx.
- Username scanner that checks 50+ websites concurrently and groups results by category (development, social, gaming, media, blogging, professional, design, security).
- Automatic GitHub deep-scan if a profile is discovered during the social scan, or if a GitHub link is queried directly.
- Risk filter that parses repositories and splits them into "interesting" vs "standard" based on sensitive keywords in metadata, popularity, and profile configuration vaults.
- Asynchronous commit history checker to fetch and audit public commits directly in the accordion UI.

## FUTURE FEATURES TASKLIST:
- Deep source code scanner looking for secrets inside files.
- Exporting scan results to JSON or PDF.
- GitHub API token support to avoid anonymous rate limits.

## FUTURE FEATURES TASKLIST:
- Analytics depth - analyze and find connections between data, names, etc.
- Deep source code scanner looking for secrets inside files.
- Exporting scan results and saving them.
- Implementing a database.
- Port to electron for easier running.
